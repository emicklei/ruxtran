# Project full name
Ruxtran - Ruby XML transformation library

# Project Purpose And Summarization
Basically, this package contains one abstract class called XMLTransformer.
It uses REXML to traverse the nodes and sends handle messages for each node.
For example, when the transformer sees the element <book> 
then it tries to send the message "handle_book" with the node as its argument.

In addition, the gem contains example classes for transforming:
xdoc (Anakia format used for Maven sites) -> html
xsd -> xdoc
wsdl -> xdoc

If you ever were asked to write XSLT to transform some complex XML files
then you know XSL can be hard to write and understand. 

The transformation part was inspired by Martin Fowler's article on Rake
